The rabbit, on the other hand, embodies cleverness and wisdom. Its role in this scene, appearing calm and in control despite the tiger's formidable presence, subtly undermines the traditional power dynamics. The pine trees, enduring symbols of resilience and longevity, frame this interaction, grounding it in a sense of timeless wisdom.
